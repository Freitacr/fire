				<h1>10/12/2019: The Resizing Update</h1>
				<p>
					Things are moving at a bit of a pace, though we can't really be sure whether or not that pace is one of a tortoise or some primate.
					After all, this update is coming ten days after mentioning that it was needed, back in the Skeleton Update. The website is likely still
					unkind to mobile use, and also some Microsoft Edge users have been reporting some intriguing behaviour in terms of how it chooses to display our pages.
					For clarity's sake, intriguing in this case is best described as expanding every element to be roughly three to four times the size we intended
					it to be.<br><br>

					That will have to be addressed later. However, the website should behave a tad bit nicer.
					It still looks like it walked out of a paint store after tipping over the grey, blue, and black sections, but that will be addressed once
					we gain a bit of a more formal training in color theory.<br><br>

					Next on the docket is back end work in preparation for getting those "Sign Up" and "Log In" buttons to be functional, so, assuming all goes well,
					be expecting more to come on that front.
				</p>

				<h1>10/10/2019: The Legal Document Update</h1>
				<p>
					You know those things that every website has? Terms and Conditions and a Privacy Policy? For any of you who clicked on the Privacy Policy button and wondered why it was blank, wonder no more as it is no longer blank! Contained inside is the Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms and Conditions for this website, and you should also notice that each and every page has a nice little footer appended stating, to put it shortly, that use of the site is implicit acceptance of the terms and conditions and privacy policy. Not very exciting, we admit, but hey, it's a necessary thing!
				</p>
				<p>
					Plus, now that is out of the way, we can begin focusing on actual true development of features that haven't had any sort of implementation started (Unusable login button, I'm looking at you!)

				<h1>10/8/2019: The Security Update</h1>
				<p>
					We can finally predict! However, we only have a small set of data usable right now and currently no way of collecting more. The entire wait for this step was due to an issue with security, hence the name of the update, we had to get a digital certification that proved that our server is under our use and not some random guy in his moms basement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Feel free to try out the prediction tab and have fun with the responses that come up!

                <p>
                    So this is a start of something ostentatious and surprising. Surprising because of how
                    quickly it is coming along, and ostentatious because the colours are astoundingly ugly.
                    As of right now, the focus of everything is to get rough web pages built, and figure out
                    the rough layouts of everything. However, as I'm certain that is readily apparent, resizing
                    any of the pages is a bit of an endeavour. That will be sorted out soon enough after the
                    inital pages are designed and roughly implemented, as there will likely be a bit of Javascript
                    involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TL;DR: Things look rough and act rougher, but they exist with some basic functionality.
