					<h1>11/26/2019: The Prediction, Archive, and Forums Update</h1>
					<p>
						We're back with better news than we hoped to have two weeks ago! As we mentioned,
						prediction has been updated into a newer format that should hopefully clear up some
						ambiguity of how we are using your input to make predictions, and also whether or not
						our program has managed to interpret your input at all with the minimial amount of data
						that we have.<br><br>

						However, in addition to that some other things have been added on, as you may have guessed
						from the title of this posting. We managed to get both the Archive and the Forums online!<br><br>
						
						The archive allows you to quickly look through the database based on fields that you want to
						search by, and returns results in much the same way as the Predictions are returned. On the 
						subject of these returns however, each and every result is now clickable, and will take you
						to the corresponding forum page when you do. These forum pages currently act just like
						a heavily simplified version of most other forums online, but we have plans to make them more
						suited to displaying even more data about a particular repair job, such as PPE requirements,
						part requirements, and hopefully more.<br><br>

						Unfortunately, we will have to be taking a short break from updating this project for the next
						two weeks to a month as we move into the initial presentations of our progress for our university.
						After that, however, we look forward to continuing on improving the functionality and usability
						of this website.<br><br>

						Cheers and have a wonderful holiday season!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="log-entry blue-entry">
					<h1>11/12/2019: The User Update</h1>
					<p>
						So, one month later and here it is, signing up and logging in are functional, so feel free to try them out and let us know how it goes. Right now, the only
						companies that exist are testing ones, and the actual purpose of being able to log in is not fleshed out yet. That will be coming in the next two weeks however,
						and this is a stronger start than we were expecting for one month of actual work.<br><br>

						Up next is tackling updating the way that predictions are returned, and potentially a bit more.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="log-entry blue-entry">
					<h1>10/12/2019: The Resizing Update</h1>
					<p>
						Things are moving at a bit of a pace, though we can't really be sure whether or not that pace is one of a tortoise or some primate.
						After all, this update is coming ten days after mentioning that it was needed, back in the Skeleton Update. The website is likely still
						unkind to mobile use, and also some Microsoft Edge users have been reporting some intriguing behaviour in terms of how it chooses to display our pages.
						For clarity's sake, intriguing in this case is best described as expanding every element to be roughly three to four times the size we intended
						it to be.<br><br>

						That will have to be addressed later. However, the website should behave a tad bit nicer.
						It still looks like it walked out of a paint store after tipping over the grey, blue, and black sections, but that will be addressed once
						we gain a bit of a more formal training in color theory.<br><br>

						Next on the docket is back end work in preparation for getting those "Sign Up" and "Log In" buttons to be functional, so, assuming all goes well,
						be expecting more to come on that front.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="log-entry blue-entry">
					<h1>10/10/2019: The Legal Document Update</h1>
					<p>
						You know those things that every website has? Terms and Conditions and a Privacy Policy? For any of you who clicked on the Privacy Policy button and wondered why it was blank, wonder no more as it is no longer blank! Contained inside is the Privacy Policy, as well as the Terms and Conditions for this website, and you should also notice that each and every page has a nice little footer appended stating, to put it shortly, that use of the site is implicit acceptance of the terms and conditions and privacy policy. Not very exciting, we admit, but hey, it's a necessary thing!
					</p>
					<p>
						Plus, now that is out of the way, we can begin focusing on actual true development of features that haven't had any sort of implementation started (Unusable login button, I'm looking at you!)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="log-entry blue-entry">
					<h1>10/8/2019: The Security Update</h1>
					<p>
						We can finally predict! However, we only have a small set of data usable right now and currently no way of collecting more. The entire wait for this step was due to an issue with security, hence the name of the update, we had to get a digital certification that proved that our server is under our use and not some random guy in his moms basement.
					</p>
					<p>
						Feel free to try out the prediction tab and have fun with the responses that come up!
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="log-entry blue-entry">
					<h1>10/2/2019: The Skeleton Update</h1>
					<p>
						So this is a start of something ostentatious and surprising. Surprising because of how
						quickly it is coming along, and ostentatious because the colours are astoundingly ugly.
						As of right now, the focus of everything is to get rough web pages built, and figure out
						the rough layouts of everything. However, as I'm certain that is readily apparent, resizing
						any of the pages is a bit of an endeavour. That will be sorted out soon enough after the
						inital pages are designed and roughly implemented, as there will likely be a bit of Javascript
						involved.
					</p>
					<p>
						TL;DR: Things look rough and act rougher, but they exist with some basic functionality.
