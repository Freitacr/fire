                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p>As of right now, the development team consists of two members, Jim Carey (no, not the actor), and Colton Freitas. Both of them are enrolled students at Pacific Lutheran University with an anticipated graduation year of 2020, both with a Bachelor of Science in computer science degree. While this project is part of the graduation requirements for the team, it is not the main reason that it exists or continues being worked on. Most projects could have satisfied the requirements, but this project is personal to both of members of the team. For one, Jim Carey's father was the whole reason this project was thought of and had work begun on it, and for two, Colton wants to see his work have tangible benefits for a wider populace than just his classmates.</p>

                <h2>This Project</h2>
                <p>
                    This project began with a simple question, 
                    &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Can you create a program that I can plug data into 
                    that will predict what is wrong with the machinery I&CloseCurlyQuote;m
                    working on?&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; That question was asked by Jim&CloseCurlyQuote;s father. 
                    After creating our best attempt at solving that problem 
                    in the six week timeline we had, we began to see the 
                    potential for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of that, we decided to take this on as
                    our final project for our University&CloseCurlyQuote;s graduation requirements.
                    Both because it was satisfactory for the project, and because
                    we wanted to see how far toward our combined vision we could
                    take it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we have a vision in mind for this project and the direction
                    that it is taking, which will be outlined below, it is by no mean
                    set in granite. If you have any suggestions or comments regarding
                    this project and its direction, please utilize the contact us section
                    at the bottom of this page.

                <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    Before getting into the specifics of our implementation goals,
                    there are three areas that we have strong goals for. These are
                    User functionality, User data protection, and Reliability & Usability.
                </p>
                <h4>User Functionality</h4>
                <h4>User Data Protection</h4>
                <h4>Reliability and Usability</h4>
